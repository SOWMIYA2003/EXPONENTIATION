# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function,Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.
2. Get input from user and call the function.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: Sowmiya N 
RegisterNumber: 21500134
*/
def exp(x):
    x=x**2
   
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",x)
x=int(input())
exp(x)
```

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](py6.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
